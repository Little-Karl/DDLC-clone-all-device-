    "That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children."
    "You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?"
    "We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up."
    "But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away."
    "However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori catch up to me."
